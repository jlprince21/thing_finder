# thing_finder
A Flutter app for tracking stored items.

Must run `flutter pub run build_runner build` to do initial generation of
database.g.dart or after database.dart is changed!

Use `flutter run --release -d <DEVICE NAME HERE>` to get a launchable version
running on a physical phone/tablet. On iOS 14 and above it won't run untethered
otherwise.
